## Panel Layout for PCB

The panel dimensions provided in the section "Original Design" below are based on my own module build, since I am not following the standard HP (1HP eq. 5.08mm) size.
An alternative by building an HP-standard size panel can be found in the section "HP Standard Design" further below.

### Original Design
Coordinates given in the table fit to the layout of components given in the PCBc in folder GerberFiles.
The layout is the same for both versions.

Panel size: 60mm x 128.5mm

The numbers in the table are refering to the numbers in the picture below.
Coordinates origin is the lower left corner of the panel.


| No. | X-coord. [mm] | Y-coord. [mm] | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 15 | 105 | Cutoff Pot |
| 2 | 30 | 105 | Cutoff CV Jack |
| 3 | 45 | 105 | Resonance Pot |
| 4 | 30 | 91 | Cutoff CV Jack |
| 5 | 15 | 85 | Filter Mode Switch |
| 6 | 45 | 85 | Noise Type Switch |
| 7 | 15 | 79 | LED |
| 8 | 45 | 79 | LED |
| 9 | 30 | 77 | Resonance CV Jack |
| 10 | 15 | 74 | LED |
| 11 | 45 | 74 | LED |
| 12 | 15 | 69 | LED |
| 13 | 45 | 69 | LED |
| 14 | 45 | 64 | LED |
| 15 | 30 | 60| Graininess Pot |
| 16 | 12 | 50 | Bias1 Pot |
| 17 | 48 | 50 | Bias2 Pot |
| 18 | 12 | 30 | VCA1 CV Jack |
| 19 | 48 | 30 | VCA2 CV Jack |
| 20 | 12 | 15| Out1 Jack |
| 21 | 48 | 15 | Out2 Jack |

### HP Standard Design
For building the panel with a size following the HP standard, you can use the panel Gerber files provided in the folder "GerberFiles".

I ordered my own panel via such gerber file built out of PCB material.

Here are a few parameters of the panel.
| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Width | 12HP |
| Pot hole diameter | 8mm |
| Jack hole diameter | 6.1mm |
| Switch hole diameter | 5.1mm |
| LED hole diameter | 3.1mm |
| Mounting hole diameter | 3.2mm|
